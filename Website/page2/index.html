      <h2>Using AngularJS/BackboneJS in Windows 8 JavaScript app</h2>

<p>To help me expand my JavaScript knowledge as I said I would in my <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2013/01/09/javascript-is-the-future-maybe/" title="JavaScript is the future…maybe!">previous post</a> I thought I’d write a Windows 8 application using JavaScript.</p>

<p>After following a few “Hello World” tutorials from Microsoft I thought I’d take a look at the ToDo list demos shown at <a href="http://TodoMVC.com">TodoMVC.com</a>.</p>

<p>This website/Github repository takes the ToDo demo and implements it in all the various JS frameworks and libraries out there. As I said previously its a minefield.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I thought I’d start with Backbone, copy the files, add the references to WinJS and hit F5 and bingo. However, I got the below error:</p>

      <h2>JavaScript is the future…maybe!</h2>

<p>I’m not one for New Years resolutions but I thought it was time I looked at JavaScript more in depth.</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/10/08/node-js-express-hello-world-formula-1-style/" title="Node.js, Express, Hello World Formula 1 Style">Node.js a while back</a> and found it very interesting and I probably need to go back to it. Over the last month or so there has been a large discussion about async in .Net frameworks and there appears to be a lot of misunderstanding about it (and lets leave it at that, I don’t want to start another flame war) but the thing we can definitely say with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, well JavaScript to be fair is that it is perfectly asynchronous and non-blocking.</p>

<p>As a web developer I have used JavaScript from the early days of Response.Write moving onto frameworks such as <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a> and <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a> and finally ending up with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> which has come pretty much a standard these days so my JavaScript skills are not completely new.</p>

<p>However, there has been a large push to use JS more and more for rich user friendly applications with things like <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">BackboneJS</a> on the client and Node.js on the server. Microsoft has even taken a prominent role in helping bring Node.js to a Windows environment as it started out on *nix based platforms. They have also started contributing to and including scripts in their Visual Studio project templates for jQuery.</p>

      <h2>Why use NancyFX?</h2>

<p>When a new project comes along why should you automatically choose ASP.NET MVC? Yes, its Microsoft based so you may have more of your peers fluent already in that architecture but is there an alternative, a better alternative?</p>

<p>I believe so and its called <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">NancyFX</a>. Your first reaction, what is so special about Nancy? I also believe you’ll ask what is wrong with ASP.NET MVC but maybe you should look at it differently and ask what is right with Nancy?</p>

<h2>What is Nancy?</h2>

<p>Nancy is a lightweight framework for building websites / services without getting in your way. It’s heavily inspired by a Ruby project called Sinatra, which happens to identify itself as not being a framework, since it doesn’t include all the plumbing of things such as an ORM, lots of configuration, etc.</p>

<h2>Does it implement MVC?</h2>

<p>Nancy does not force you to adhere to the model-view-controller pattern, or any other pattern. It’s nothing more than a service endpoint responding to HTTP verbs. Making it ideal for building Websites, Web Services and APIs.</p>

      <h2>Easily publish a NuGet package</h2>

<p>I recently published <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/11/29/asp-net-web-api-testing/" title="ASP.NET Web API Testing">WebAPI.Testing</a> on <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/WebAPI.Testing">Nuget</a> but found it a bit tricky to build a package ready for NuGet.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/creating-packages/creating-and-publishing-a-package">documentation </a>about how to do it but I found it hard to follow so I thought I’d document how I finally got my package ready.</p>

<p>The easiest way I thought was to have something built into Visual Studio. I spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfowl">David Fowler</a> and he told me you can edit your *.csproj file and add <code>&lt;BuildPackage&gt;true&lt;/BuildPackage&gt;</code> to it.</p>

<p>When you build your project a *.nupkg is created ready for publishing with NuGet.</p>

      <h2>ASP.NET Web API Testing</h2>

<p>As the need arose to implement some kind of Web Service/HTTP API I thought I would evaluate <a href="http://nancyfx.org/">NancyFX</a>, <a href="http://www.asp.net/web-api">ASP.NET Web API</a> and <a href="http://www.servicestack.net/">ServiceStack</a>.</p>

<p>Suffice to say all performed as expected and I was actually surprised to find that implementing ASP.NET Web API was easier than ServiceStack (I know that might be a bit of a statement to make to the ServiceStack followers, sorry). I found Nancy easiest to implement. The very simple API demos can be found on <a href="http://github.com/jchannon">my Github page</a>.</p>

<p>When it came to testing ASP.NET Web API I found it to be wanting slightly in comparison to Nancy. With WebAPI I could make direct calls to the controller methods to make sure data was returned correctly and I could mock a repository and test that the methods in the repository were being called but there was nothing I could see to test the HTTP response I would get.</p>

      <h2>The For Loop is the devil in disguise</h2>

<p>I recently spoke to someone about the ‘for’ loop who opened my eyes to how unstructured the ‘for’ loop is.</p>

<p>I have only ever used it in the traditional sense of:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>I looked into some more and thought I’d show anybody else who may not have known about this innocent little thing in the C# language. It may exist in other languages but I am explicitly talking about C#.</p>

<pre><code>for (; ; )
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hi");
}
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason this compiles and executes! Who knew? Smarter people than me obviously. What do you expect it to output?</p>

<p>The answer is it outputs “Hi” forever as there is nothing to determine when the loop should end however there is nothing to determine when it should start either.</p>

      <h2>.gitignore not working – fixed!</h2>

<p>This happens to me too often and I always end up googling the answer so this post is probably more of a location I know I can come to find the answer, although by writing it down hopefully it may sink in that I should stop getting too excited on a new project.</p>

<h3>New project scenario</h3>

<p>You’re all very excited about your new project and you think its about time you committed this to source control. Obviously you’re using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> so you initialise a new repository and commit your files. You then setup a remote repository at <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> and it asks you whether you want it create a .gitignore file – you do. So now you have a repository remotely and locally. Easiest thing to do is pull from the remote, setup your remote and push to it. The other scenario might be you’ve committed locally and then realise you need to add a .gitignore file which you do and then commit.</p>

      <h2>Publishing to Windows Azure from Github</h2>

<p>Back in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2012/09/17/announcing-great-improvements-to-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx">July 2012</a> Microsoft announced improvements to Azure Web Sites. One of those improvements was to Git publishing so when you pushed changes to your Github repository Azure would automatically pick that up and deploy the project. I even mentioned it in my <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/" title="NancyFX, RavenDB, NerdDinner and Me">DinnerParty blog post</a> but have only just looked at implementing it.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>As I said in my previous post Azure supported Git publishing but it was a two step process. You push to Github and then push to Azure and it gets deployed. If you already have Git setup on your Azure account there is nowhere in the dashboard that allows to you setup Github integration. I thought I was going to have reset my deployment credentials and set it all up again when I asked the question on <a href="http://jabbr.net">Jabbr</a>. Luckily <a href="http://twitter.com/davidfowl">David Fowler</a> was online. Why is that lucky? He wrote the Github integration feature of Azure.</p>

<p>To setup your Azure account to enable Github integration you have to FTP into your Azure account and delete the deployment history by deleting all contents in the /site/deployments folder.</p>

      <h2>Simple .Net Twitter,Google,Facebook Authentication</h2>

<p>Logging into websites is no longer a matter of typing in your username and password and clicking the login button. If you already have an account with the main social networks you can log into a site using your credentials from that website saving you having to register your details <em>again</em>. This obviously makes things a bit easier as you don’t have to remember another password. (Although you should all be using a password manager such as <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">LastPass</a>.)</p>

<h2>Current Social Login Providers</h2>

<p>There are currently providers out there that allow you to use their services to integrate into your website to provide authentication via the social networks. The main two that I know of are <a href="http://janrain.com">Janrain</a> and <a href="http://www.dotnetopenauth.net/">DotNetOpenAuth</a>. I’ve not worked with DotNetOpenAuth but I have with Janrain when building <a href="http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2012/09/21/nancyfx-ravendb-nerddinner-and-me/">DinnerParty</a>.</p>

<p>The process was reasonably easy but not as simple as it could be.</p>

      <h2>Testing your application’s email logic</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever written an application that sends out email you may have written the code and executed it numerous times to check that the logic works and that the email appears as you hope. This obviously means you have to hit your SMTP server each time, open your email client and check your emails each time.</p>

<h3>Papercut</h3>

<p>Reading through my Twitter timeline I saw <a href="http://twitter.com/TheCodeJunkie">@TheCodeJunkie</a> asking about the app that you can use to test sending emails from your application.</p>

<p>![TheCodeJunkie Tweet][2]</p>

<p>Intrigued, I kept an eye on my timeline and found that the application in question was <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/">Papercut</a></p>
